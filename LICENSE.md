**You may**: [Download the mod from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flamingo-oh-oh-oh) and add
it to your modpacks, as long as the mod is downloaded at runtime instead of being bundled as part of the
modpack download. CurseForge modpacks created using the Twitch launcher (or upcoming Overwolf-owned CurseForge
launcher) meet this requirement under normal circumstances.
